* Jekyll's handler for org-protocol

=org-protocol= scans the list of filenames passed to the Emacs server for =org-protocol:/sub-protocol:/= and triggers actions associated with =sub-protocol=. =org-protocol-jekyll= realizes the =jekyll= sub-protocol to open sources of a site built with [[http://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]] in Emacs for editing. Add the following line in the Emacs initialization file:
#+begin_src lisp
  (require 'org-protocol-jekyll)
#+end_src
The list of Jekyll's sites is contained in customizable variable =org-protocol-jekyll-alist= and takes the form
#+begin_src lisp
  (setq org-protocol-jekyll-alist
        '(("Jekyll's awesome website."
           :base-url "http://jekyllrb.com"
           :permalink "pretty"
           :working-directory "/home/user/jekyll"
           :working-suffix (".md", ".markdown"))
          ("Local Jekyll's site."
           :base-url "http://localhost:4000"
           :permalink "pretty"
           :working-directory "/home/user/jekyll"
           :working-suffix (".md", ".markdown"))))
#+end_src
where =:base-url= is the base URL of the Jekyll's site (e.g. =http://www.example.com/project=), =:permalink= is the [[http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks][permalink]] to generate URLs for the site, =:working-directory= is the local working directory of the site, =:working-suffix= is the acceptable suffixes for the file converted to HTML by Jekyll. =:working-suffix= can be a list of suffixes, e.g. =(".md", ".markdown")=, or one suffix, e.g. =​".org"​=. By default, only files with suffix =​".html"​= are taken into account.

The easiest way to install =org-protocol-jekyll= is through [[http://marmalade-repo.org][Marmalade package archive]].
